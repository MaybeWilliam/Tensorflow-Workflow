# Tensorflow and Keras Basic
These are basic Neural networks implemented in Tensorflow(also Keras). All the code is simplified, and I've tried to use standard programming practices for readability. Also I have included comments wherever possible, for understanding purposes.

A huge shoutout to [Siraj Raval](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A) for getting me all crazy and interested about cognitive computing!
