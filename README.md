# Tensorflow and Keras Basic
These are basic Neural networks implemented in Tensorflow(also Keras). All the code is simplified, and I've tried to use standard programming practices for readability. Also I have included comments wherever possible, for understanding purposes.

A huge shoutout to [Siraj Raval](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A) for getting me all crazy and interested about cognitive computing!

# Model Implementation & documentation:
I have implemented the following models in Tensorflow and i'm listing them here for easy navigation:
* [Logistic regression v2](https://github.com/satyaSK/Tensorflow-Workflow/tree/master/Logistic-Regression)
* [Artificial Neural Net](https://github.com/satyaSK/Tensorflow-Workflow/tree/master/ANN-using-Tensorflow)
* [Convolutional Neural Net](https://github.com/satyaSK/Tensorflow-Workflow/tree/master/CNN-using-Tensorflow-and-Keras)
* [Implementation of Recurrent Neural Nets using LSTM](https://github.com/satyaSK/Tensorflow-Workflow/tree/master/LSTMs-using-Tensorflow)
